20+ years ago things looked like this:

   Possible future scenarios


Theoretical basis:

* Einstein ``general relativity theory``: energy/mass curves space-time,
  an isolated object moves along a "straight" line in a curved space-time
* ``Cosmological principle``: Universe is homogeneous and isotropic at the largest scale

Dark energy: accelerated expansion of our Universe
--------------------------------------------------

Two competing teams `High-Z Supernova Search Team`_ and `Supernova Cosmology Project`_
have been trying to measure the history of the expansion rate of our Universe
from high red shift `Type Ia supernovae`_. The common sense tells that the expansion
rate should slow down with the time. The data suggested otherwise: in the past
the expansion rate has been smaller.

Nobody knows what really drives the accelerated expansion. The mainstream
hypothesis is a ``cosmological constant`` (also known as the ``vacuum energy``).
However the prediction of the vacuum energy density by the ``quantum field theory``
is 120 orders of magnitude off.

Dark matter: formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters
------------------------------------------------------

Non-barionic matter (which does not interact with light) seems to exist,
and constitutes about 25% of the energy density of our Universe.


Evidence 1: galaxy clusters (in particular `Coma cluster`_) contain
400x more gravitating mass than that of luminous `Fritz Zwicky, 1933`_
(hence the name `dark matter`). Virial theorem: K.E. = -1/2 P.E.

Evidence 2: the angular speed of stars in the center of our galaxy is almost the same as of stars in the halo

Evidence 3: 380 kiloyears AB our Universe looked like this:

   `Cosmic microwave background`_ temperature fluctuations map, 10^-5 K (according to `Planck satellite`_ data)

Although this looks pretty uniform, the amount of the observed (luminous) matter
is not enough to form such fluctuations in 380000 years, and it's also not enough
for forming clusters of galaxies:

   The `2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey`_ data


In a nutshell, the ordinary matter clumps into relatively small dense objects
(stars, planets, etc) due to electromagnetic interaction: there is a friction
so collapsing gas can transform its kinetic energy to a thermal one (and thus
stars or planets can form). Many of such objects can be very dim and remain
unobserved electromagnetically (neither in the optical, radio, X-ray bands),
however their gravitational effect ``microlensing`` should be measurable.
Several experiments have been carried out:

- MACHO_ (1993 - 1999)
- EROS_ (1993 - 2002)
- OGLE_ (1992 - ), discovered 6 exoplanets by microlensing
- MOA_ (1998 - ), yet another 7 exoplanets (and confirme one by OGLE_)
- SuperMACHO_ (2001 - )

The net conclusion is that contribution of compact dark objects into the energy density of
the universe is way too small for them to be a viable ``dark matter`` candidate.

Dark matter should be something which clumps at the scale of galaxies/clusters
of galaxies, but does not form any smaller structures. Most likely such substance
does not interact electromagnetically (i.e. transparent for the light, radio,
microwave, X-rays). Dark matter can't consist of any particles of
the `Standard Model of fundamental interactions and particles`_.

My pet hypothesis is neutralino_/lightest supersymmetric particle ``dark matter``.
However there's supersymmetry_ is not confirmed experimentally yet, neither are
other conjectures.

   Future expansion of our Universe

* Local group will eventually merge into one super-galaxy
* Everything else will lost the casual contact due to ever accelerating space expansion
* Star formation stops in 10^14 years
* Big Freeze in 10^100 years


The Universe or Our Universe?
-----------------------------

The Multiverse conjecture: distant parts of Universe have become isolated
from each other by the cosmological expansion in a fraction of a second
after the Big Bang. Perhaps there are regions which haven't ever interacted,
and won't ever have a chance to interact due to the cosmological expansion.
Can the fundamental physical constants or even the physical laws be
different in such regions? A casually connected region is called a universe,
and the collection of all universes is called multiverse.

No definitive experimental evidences so far. There've been some papers
regrarding  a possible non-random component of the `peculiar velocity`_
of galaxy clusters (`Dark flow`_)
