How do we know that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating?

Introduction: Big Bang cosmology
================================

25+ years ago (circa 1995) things looked like this:

   Possible future scenarios


Theoretical basis
-----------------

* Einstein ``general relativity theory``: energy/mass curves space-time,
  an isolated object moves along a "straight" line in a curved space-time
* ``Cosmological principle``: Universe is homogeneous and isotropic at the largest scale


Measuring the past expansion rate
---------------------------------

* `Brightness of distant type Ia supernovae`_
* `Anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background_`


Brightness of distant type Ia supernovae
========================================

* `Type Ia supernovae`_ have the same luminosity -> distance
* Red shift of spectrum -> scale factor at the explision time
* Red shifts of close(r) supernovae and galaxies -> current expansion rate

z = 1 supernova, a(t) = 1/(1+z) = 1/2 (the Universe was 1/2 of its current size).
With large expansion rate it takes smaller time to expand from 1/2 to the current.
Thus light had to travel a smaller distance, and high-z supernovae should
have appeared brighter (than calculated from the present expansion rate).

Experiments
-----------

* `High-Z Supernova Search Team`_ 
* `Supernova Cosmology Project`_

High-z supernovae appear **dimmer** -> The expansion rate was smaller in the past

----

* Size of circles ~ sound_speed x 380 kY
  - Independent check: size of largest structures (galaxy clusters)
* More dark matter -> more compression
* More regular matter -> bigger bounce
* Angular size depends on the Universe shape
  - Observed data suggest the 3d-flat Universe -> Dark Energy

Physical cause of the accelerated expansion
===========================================

Nobody knows for sure. A simplest hyposesis consistent with observations
is a ``cosmological constant`` (also known as the ``vacuum energy``).
Gotcha: the prediction of the vacuum energy density by ``quantum field theory``
is 120 orders of magnitude off.
